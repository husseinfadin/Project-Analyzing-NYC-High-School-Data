Analyzing NYC High School Data.<br>
in this project we will be exploring the Data and answer some questions we'll be using data about New York City public schools, which can be found here [links](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?category=Education).

One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.

The same website has several related data sets covering demographic information and test scores. Here are the links to all of the data sets we'll be using:

SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City<br>
Class size - Information on class size for each school<br>
AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)<br>
Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information.<br>
Demographics - Demographic information for each school.<br>
School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school.<br>
